# Exa Google Sheets Extension

## Description

This Google Apps Script integration brings the power of the Exa API directly into Google Sheets, allowing you to search the web, query information, find similar content, and extract website content without leaving your spreadsheet.

## Features

### Custom Sheet Functions
* **EXA_ANSWER:** Query the Exa AI to get answers to questions based on web search results
* **EXA_SEARCH:** Search the web and retrieve a list of relevant URLs
* **EXA_CONTENTS:** Extract the text content from specific URLs
* **EXA_FINDSIMILAR:** Find URLs similar to a provided reference URL

### Sidebar Interface
* **API Key Management:** Securely save your Exa API key
* **Documentation:** Built-in reference for all Exa functions and their parameters
* **Batch Refresh:** Refresh multiple Exa function cells at once

## Setup & Installation

1.  **Open your Google Sheet:** Go to the Google Sheet where you want to use this script.
2.  **Open the Script Editor:** Click on "Extensions" > "Apps Script".
3.  **Copy the Code:**
    *   Copy the contents of `Code.gs` from this project and paste it into the `Code.gs` file in the Apps Script editor. Overwrite any existing template code.
    *   Create a new HTML file in the editor (File > New > HTML file). Name it `Sidebar.html` (ensure the name matches exactly, including capitalization).
    *   Copy the contents of the `Sidebar.html` file from this project and paste it into the newly created `Sidebar.html` file in the editor.
4.  **Save the Project:** Click the floppy disk icon (Save project) and give your script project a name (e.g., "Exa for Sheets").
5.  **Refresh Your Sheet:** Close the Apps Script editor tab and refresh your Google Sheet browser tab.
6.  **Authorize the Script:**
    *   After refreshing, a new custom menu item "Exa AI" should appear. Click on it, then select "Open Sidebar".
    *   A dialog box will pop up asking for authorization. Review the permissions requested (it will need access to external services, script properties, and the current spreadsheet) and click "Allow". You might need to go through an "Advanced" > "Go to (project name)" flow if Google warns it's an unverified app.
7.  **Set Your API Key:**
    *   Once authorized, the sidebar will open with the API Key tab active.
    *   Go to [https://exa.ai/](https://exa.ai/) to get your API key if you don't have one.
    *   Paste your Exa API key into the input field in the sidebar and click "Save API Key".
    *   You should see a success message "API key saved successfully.".

## Using the Sidebar

The sidebar offers three main tabs:

### 1. API Key
* Set or update your Exa API key
* View status of key operations

### 2. Batch
* Refresh selected cells containing Exa functions
* Status updates for refresh operations

### 3. Documentation
* Comprehensive documentation for all Exa functions
* Parameter descriptions and return value information
* Quick reference for function syntax
